[Work In Progress] Made in 2024, to be updated.
A very simple Event Manager Web App that allows you to create and organize events for a group of people. 

Features:
- Create events with multiple options for the users to select from. (E.g a watch party in cinema may have 3 options: standard (standard chair, no gift), exclusive (VIP chair, some gifts), god (all benefits, tons of gifts),... )
- Set registration time for users to participate. No registration will be accepted outside that time.
- Limited slots with first-come-first-serve strategy for registrations. All participants will receive an email on the end of registration date to let them know if they are picked.
- During the event day, an email will automatically be sent to notify the successfully registered users.
- The organizer can perform checkin for the participants when they arrive.
- Display the report for the event.
